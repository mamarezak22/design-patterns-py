# design patterns written in sweet python

## what is design patterns?
Design patterns are simply common solutions to different programming problems, especially in the context of object-oriented programming.
They are not tied to any specific programming language and are not actual code. Instead, they are general templates or approaches that can be implemented in any language that supports object-oriented principles.

They are typically divided into three main categories : **creational** , **structural** , **behavorial**.
